# cbgb - couchbase giga-buckets

cbgb is a project where we can experiment with next-generation server
ideas (ignoring various legacy production compatibility requirements)
and at a fast pace (leveraging go as a more productive development
language).  In particular, there's an initial focus on
high-multitenancy (high number of buckets).
